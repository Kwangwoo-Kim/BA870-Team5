### Gaming Data Overview and backgrond knowledge
##### 1.Brief description and data soure
The gaming data set has information of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies since the year 1980 to 2016. This [gaming data set](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) is downloaded from [Kaggle.com](www.kaggle.com).

Mobile, PC/Mac(computer), social/online, and console are common gaming platforms. Console here refers to computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play". Some popular consoles are PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One X, Nintendo Switch. Our dataset is about videogames played on console only.  

##### 2.Data Cleaning 
* We $\color{red}{\text{removed}}$ all **NULL** values, **Unknown** values, data in **2017 or later**.
* We $\color{red}{\text{converted}}$ Year from **String** to **Date**. 
* We $\color{red}{\text{added}}$ a new column called *Portable* based on if the gaming console is portable or not. 
* We have `r nrow(games)` rows and `r ncol(games)` variables after cleaning the data and adding the *Portable* variable. 

##### 3.Variables 
| Variable   |      Description      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Rank |  Ranking of overall sales | 
| Name |    The games name   |   
| Platform | Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.) |    
| Year | Year of the game's release |
| Genre | Genre - Genre of the game |
| Publisher |Publisher of the game |
|NA_Sales|Sales in North America (in millions) | 
| EU_Sales| Sales in Europe (in millions) |
|JP_Sales |Sales in Japan (in millions) |
| Other_Sales|Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) |
|Global_Sales|Total worldwide sales |
| Portable | If the gaming console is portable (1=yes,0=no) |

##### 4.Glimpse of Data 
###### a.
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)
games$Portable <- factor(games$Portable)
str(games)
```

###### b.
`r length(unique(games$Platform))` unique platforms: 
`r unique(games$Platform) `

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
unique(games$Platform)
```

###### c.
`r length(unique(games$Genre))` unique genres: 
`r unique(games$Genre) `

###### d. 
```{r include=FALSE}
top_ten <- function(x) {
  df_temp <- count(x, Publisher, sort = TRUE)
  return(df_temp$Publisher[1:10])
}
```
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
top_ten(games)
```

`r length(unique(games$Publisher))` unique publishers  
Top 10 Publishers based on frequency: `r top_ten(games)`


### Problem Set
##### 1. What publishers, platforms, and games generated the highest revenue?
###### a. Highest revenue generating publishers
```{r}
top10 <- subset(games, Publisher %in% c("Nintendo",""))
View(top10)


```
###### b. Highest revenue generating platforms
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(games, aes(x=Platform, y=GLobal_Sales)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y=sum, geom="bar",position=position_dodge(1),width=0.8,show.legend = F,,col="white",fill="black")+coord_flip()+theme_economist()
ggplotly(p1)
```
###### c.Highest revenue generating games 
```{r}




```



##### 2. Are there any overarching trends over the past ~30 years?

##### 3. What platforms, publishers, and genres seem to be popular at certain periods of time from 1980-2016 ?
```{r}
library(plotly)
ani <- ggplot(games, aes(Year, GLobal_Sales)) +
    geom_point(aes(frame = Year))

ani <- ggplotly(ani)
```








##### 4. Highest revenue generating platforms and genres over the past ~30 years for particular regions?
